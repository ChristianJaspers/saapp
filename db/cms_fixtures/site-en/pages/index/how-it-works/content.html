  The challenges
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Sales arguments are often managed randomly and individually. Two different sales guys will tell you two different stories about the same product.</li>
  <li>Training is expensive and infrequent. New products keep rolling out from the factory, so it’s hard to keep everyone up to date.</li>
  <li>Staff turnaround drains the company for knowledge and requires training of new people. We know you hate to lose your best sales guys. </li>
  <li>At product launches and campaigns it’s hard to get everyone to focus on the right sales arguments.</li>
  <li>Low knowledge sharing among sales reps prevents them from learning from each other.</li>
  <li>Mostly top-down. How can you convert real customer feedback into powerful sales arguments shared amongst all team members?</li>
</ul>
