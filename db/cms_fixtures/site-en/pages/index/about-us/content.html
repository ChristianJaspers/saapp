<h2>About us</h2>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bettersalesman/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/010/original/photo.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="130" />BetterSalesman is invented by the three sales professionals, Christian Jaspers, Torben Thomassen and Tom Samuelsen, who have done almost everything within B2B and B2C sales including direct sales, product training, managing international sales organizations etc.</p>
<h2>Need for dynamic sales arguments</h2>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bettersalesman/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/010/original/photo.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="130" />They realized that often sales arguments are often outdated once they&nbsp;reach the pitch of the sales team. New products are constantly launched and staff rotation is a constant challenge for sales managers in keeping everyone up to date with the most recent product knowledge. And what&rsquo;s more, too many sales people &ndash; both in the field and in management &ndash; still focus too much on features and forget to translate it into customer benefits.</p>
<h2>Identify, learn and share</h2>
<p><img style="float: left;" src="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/bettersalesman/comfy/cms/files/files/000/000/010/original/photo.jpg" alt="" width="98" height="130" />So&nbsp;they came up with the idea to build an app that each sales manager can personalize for his or her team in order to help them identify, learn and rate the best sales arguments. And acknowledging that HQ does not always know everything, the BetterSalesman app allows reps to add more arguments and share them with each other and with sales managers in a fun and easy way.</p>
<p>Now selling becomes easier because everyone has constant access to the best sales arguments at their fingertips. The BetterSalesman app has built-in gamification mechanics to help boost reps&rsquo; engagement and motivation by competing and sharing with each other.</p>
