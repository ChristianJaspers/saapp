<h2>Constant sales training</h2>
<p>
  Sales arguments are dynamic. They constantly change due to new products, new variants, competition etc. So staying up to date requires daily attention and effort – not only at yearly or quarterly product training meetings in remote conference rooms with overloaded agendas. </p>
<p>
Selling is individual. The sales process is not. There are tools and methods that, when applied correctly, simply work.
</p>

<h2>Share what works</h2>
<p>
Knowledge sharing does not always occur – especially not in highly competitive areas such as a sales organization. By using the competitiveness of your sales force to increase knowledge sharing, everybody wins.
</p>
