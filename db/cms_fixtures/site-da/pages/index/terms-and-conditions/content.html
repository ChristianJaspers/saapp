By accepting this TOS or by accessing or using the Service or Site, You acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this TOS. If You are entering into this TOS on behalf of a company or other legal entity, You represent that You have the authority to bind such entity and its affiliates to these TOS, in which case the terms "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity and its affiliates. If You do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with these TOS, You must not accept these TOS and may not use the Service.</p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong> BetterSalesman may change this TOS from time to time without prior notice.

The revised terms and conditions will become effective upon posting and if You use the Service after that date, we will treat your use as acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to this TOS is not acceptable to You, your only remedy is to stop accessing and using the Service.</p>
<h2>2 Description of Service</h2>
<p>The "Service" includes (a) the Site, (b) the on-demand BetterSalesman App, and (c) all software, data, text, images, sounds, video, and content made available through the Site or services (collectively referred to as the "Content").

<p>"BETTERSALESMAN" and BetterSalesman&rsquo;s various logos used or displayed on the Service are trademarks of BetterSalesman and you may only use these trademarks or logos for promotional purposes to identify yourself as a customer or user of the BetterSalesman products and services, provided you do not attempt to claim ownership of the marks by incorporating any of them within your names or offerings.</p>
<h2>5 Payment and Refunds</h2>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> The Service is made available on both a 30 days free trial and a pay-as-you-go basis. If you have elected to a Paid Plan, You will be billed monthly starting on the day where the 30 days free trial expires. You can cancel a Paid Plan at any time and You will not be billed again.

BetterSalesman will use best efforts to publish on the Site or notify You about any planned downtime of the Service, and will use all reasonable efforts to contact you directly via email to warn you prior to suspension or termination of your account. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.

You acknowledge that BetterSalesman does not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, error-free or virus-free and no information or advice obtained by you from BetterSalesman or through the service shall create any warranty not expressly stated in this TOS.</p>

<p><strong>8.1</strong> under no circumstances and under no legal theory (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) shall BetterSalesman be liable to you or any third party for any indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, consequential or punitive damages, including lost profits, lost sales or business, lost data or business interruption. In addition, BetterSalesman shall not be liable for any direct damages, costs, losses or liabilities in excess of the monthly service fee paid or payable by you for the one month preceding the time of any claim for monetary damages. The provisions of this section allocate the risks under this TOS between the parties, and the parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into this agreement.</p>
<p><strong>8.2</strong> Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply to you. IN THESE STATES, BETTERSALESMAN&rsquo;S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
